# TODO : 

1. I have set up the database, and have an API. Is that all there is to it ? Yes. Now, we'll create users, who can visit places, and do other stuff. Let's see how to create that. 
2. We need the user to be able to do these things : 
   1. Create an account on the website with a username and password.
   2. Create an account on the website with a Github account
   3. Users can wishlist places, and remove them from the wishlist.
   4. Users can visit places, and remove them from the visited list
   5. Users can add reviews to places, and remove them
   6. Users can create travel lists, and add places to them. Wishlist and Visited are default lists. 
   7. Users can edit information about themselves. Each person has : 
        i. Name
        ii. Email
        iii. Profile Picture
        iv. Bio
